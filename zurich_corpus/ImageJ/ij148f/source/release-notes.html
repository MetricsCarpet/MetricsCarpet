<li> <u>1.48f 30 October 2013</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Vytas Bindokas, the reported Feret's diameter angle is now between -90 and +90 degrees
and the "if (angle>90) angle+=180" correction is no longer needed
(<a href="macros/DrawFeretDiameter.txt">Home</a>).
<li> The Recorder now records <i>File&gt;Import&gt;Import URL</i> as
open(url) (macro mode) or imp=IJ.openImage(url) (script or Java mode).
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid and Audrey O'Neill, ImageJ can now read MJPG-encoded
files where the size of the JPEG frames differs from the size of the movie frames.
<li> Thanks to Jan Eglinger, fixed a bug that caused the Recorder to
record duplicate parameters when recording IJ.getFilePath().
<li> Thanks to Ivan Micetic, fixed a bug that caused <i>File&gt;Revert</i>
to not restore image properties and LUTs.
<li> Thanks to Christophe Leterrier, fixed a v1.48a regression that caused
selections names longer than 20 characters displayed in the results table
to be truncated.
<li> Thanks to Bill Heeschen, fixed a v1.48e regression that caused the
<i>Process&gt;Filters&gt;Convolve</i> command to fail.
</ul>
