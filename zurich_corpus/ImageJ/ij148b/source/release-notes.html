<li> <u>1.48b 25 August 2013</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Michael Doube and Johannes Schindelin, added the "Interpolate ROIs" 
command to the ROI Manager.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, submenus are now supported in the <i>Plugins&gt;Macros</i> menu
(<a href="macros/examples/MacroSubMenus.txt">example</a>).
<li> Updated the templates generated by the <i>Plugins&gt;New&gt;Plugin</i> and
<i>Plugins&gt;New&gt;Plugin Filter</i> commands.
<li> Rather than display an error message, the <i>Copy</i> and <i>Cut</i>
commands now copy or cut the entire image when there is a line or point selection.
<li> Added the ImageProcessor.set(double) method, which is used by the
<i>Process&gt;Macro&gt;Set</i> command.
<li> Thanks to Eric Barnhill, added the HyperStackConverter.toHyperStack() method.
A call to this method is generated if the recorder is running in script mode when the
<i>Image&gt;Hyperstacks&gt;Stack to Hyperstack</i> command is used.
<li> The <i>Plugins&gt;Macros&gt;StartupMacros</i> command works
when the startup macros file is names StartupMacros.ijm.
<li> The ImageConvert class works with stacks.
<li> Thanks to Johannes Schindelin and Hans Wurscht, fixed a bug that sometimes caused
memory used by images opened in batch mode macros to not be reclaimed
(<a href="macros/GarbageCollectionTest.txt">test macro</a>).
<li> Fixed a bug that caused run("Command") macro calls to run in a separate thread
if "Command" was a macro installed in the <i>Plugins&gt;Macros</i> submenu.
<li> Thanks to Jan Brocher, fixed a bug that caused <i>Image&gt;Overlay&gt;Flatten</i>
to sometimes not work as expected with RGB stacks.
<li> Thanks to Gilles Carpentier, fixed a bug in the macro interpreter that caused
it to incorrectly assign expanded arrays.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that caused the <i>FFT</i> command
to incorrectly display power spectra of RGB images.
<li> Thanks to Alberto Duina, fixed a 1.48a regression that sometimes caused the 
ImageJ.updateAndDraw() method to throw an exception.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused the IJ.getImage() method to display a "...Macro cancelled" 
error when using the "Compile and Run" command and no image was open.
<li> Thanks to Gilles Carpentier, fixed a bug that sometimes caused the 
particle analyzer to display a blank Results table.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that caused ImageJ to not correctly
save 16-bit grayscale images in PNG format.
<li> Thanks to Alberto Duina, fixed bugs that caused <i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Interpolate</i>
to create straight line selections shorter than the original and to not work
correctly with straight lines selections wider than one.
