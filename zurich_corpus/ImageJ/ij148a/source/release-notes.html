installed correctly.

<i>Edit&gt;Copy</i> command in the "Results" window to
not work with one line tables.

3D filters in <i>Process&gt;Filters</i> to not work correctly

unexpected results from setting the "plugins.dir" Java property.

<i>Process&gt;Filters</i> to throw an exception if the selection was outside the image.
<li> Thanks to Gilles Carpentier, fixed a bug that caused a corrupted file to be
created when using the setMetadata("Info","") macro function on a composite color
image with an overlay and saving in TIFF format.
<li> Thanks to Dimiter Prodanov, fixed a bug that sometimes caused a displayed stack 
to become inconsistent after the ImageStack was updated.
<li> Thanks to Julien Berro, fixed a bug the caused the ROI Manager "Update" function
to sometimes not work as expected with hyperstacks.
<li> Thanks to Karsten, fixed a bug that caused <i>Analyze&gt;Measure</i> to add

name, to labels in the Results table "Label" column.
