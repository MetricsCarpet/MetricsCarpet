<li> <u>1.48s 6 March 2014</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Niko Ehrenfeuchter, ImageJ works better on Linux systems with multiple displays.
<li> Thanks to Johannes Schindelin, added the <i>Window&gt;Main Window [return]</i>
menu command. On Windows, the command is <i>Main Window [enter]</i>.
<li> Thanks to Philippe Gendre, added a "Marker size:" menu
to the <i>Edit&gt;Options&gt;Point Tool</i> dialog box. The choices are
"Tiny", "Small" (the default), "Mediam" and "Large".
<li> Thanks to Jeremy Sword, added a "Zero transparent" option to the
<i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Image to Selection</i> and <i>Image&gt;Overlay&gt;Add Image</i>
commands.
<li> The recorder no longer records default options (e.g., 'size=0-Infinity') when recording
<i>Analyze&gt;Analyze Particles</i>, <i>File&gt;Import&gt;Image Sequence</i> and
<i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Z Project</i>.
<li> <i>Image&gt;Show Info</i> displays the image's screen location and,
in parentheses, the screen dimensions.
<li> <i>Plugins&gt;Utilities&gt;ImageJ Properties</i> displays "Max window bounds"
and the bounds of all monitors on systems with multiple monitors.
<li> When creating a straight line selection, the angle displayed in the status
bar is now calculated using sub-pixel resolution.
<li> Added the GenericDialog.setSmartRecording() method, which allows plugins
to suppress recording of default dialog box parameters.
<li> Thanks to Matt Smith, fixed a bug that could cause a deadlock 
when using the stack window scrollbar to move throuh the slices.
<li> Thanks to Jiri Janacek, fixed a bug that caused alt-click removal of
a point selection to fail if the point was over an overlay element.
<li> Thanks to Aaron Schain, fixed a bug that caused
<i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Tools&gt;Concatenate</i> to sometimes not work
as expected with hyperstacks.
<li> Thanks to Stoyan Pavlov, fixed a bug in the Roi Manager that caused ROIs
to not be updated after changing the position in the More&gt;&gt;Properties dialog box.
<li> Thanks to Josh Balsam, fixed a bug in <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Tools&gt;Make Substack</i>
that caused it to not work in batch mode macros.
<li> Thanks to Ryota Homma, fixed a bug that caused NonBlockingGenericDialogs to
not be removed from the Window menu when the dialog was closed.
<li> Thanks to Jan Brocher, fixed a bug that caused <i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Make Band</i>
to fail if "EDM output" was not set to "Overwrite" in <i>Process&gt;Binary&gt;Options</i>.
<li> Thanks to Gabriel Landini, fixed a 1.48r regression that caused the
<i>Image&gt;Adjust&gt;Threshold</i> dialog to throw an exception if it was
activated when already open.
<li> Thanks to John Lim, fixed a 1.48q regression that caused the run("RGB Color") macro 
function to not work as expected with composite color images in batch mode macros.
