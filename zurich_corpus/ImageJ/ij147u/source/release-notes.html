<li> <u>1.47u 25 June 2013</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Tiago Ferreira, the <i>Plugins&gt;Utilities&gt;Search</i> command now displays
"Double-click on a file name to open it" in the Log window header bar.
<li> Added a "Keep after adding to overlay" option to the arrow tool options dialog box.
<li> Thanks to Elyse Aurbach, <i>Analyze&gt;Calibrate</i> supports four more
calibration functions and displays better calibration plots. 
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, added the debug("conditional") macro function.
<li> Thanks to Ved Sharma, fixed a bug that caused the particle analyzer to always create a
new "Summary of ..." table when processing stack slices.
<li> Thanks to Tiago Ferreira, fixed a bug in the Overlay.activateSelection() macro
function that caused it to ignore stack positions.
<li> Thanks to Barry DeZonia, fixed a bug that caused <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Tools&gt;Reverse</i>
to not work with virtual stacks defined in Imglib.
<li> Thanks to C Heeney, fixed a bug in the PolygonRoi class that caused
it to modify the contains of float arrays passed to it in the constructor.
<li> Thanks to Sebastien Simard, fixed a bug that caused multi-line arguments passed to user
plugins to be displayed in the Log window when ImageJ was in debug mode.
<li> Thanks to Jerome Mutterer, fixed a v1.47 regression that caused command line options
similar to "-Dplugins.dir=..\ImageJ" to not work as expected.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused the paths returned by getDirectory("image") and getDirectory("macros")
to be incorrect if the path specified in the "-Dplugins.dir=path" command line option ended in "plugins".
<li> Thanks to Andrew York, fixed a bug that caused macros run from the command line
to sometimes unexpectedly display dialog boxes.
<li> Thanks to Alberto Duina and Gabriel Landini, fixed a v1.47t regression that caused
an exception to be thrown if a string with a length less than 3 was entered into a dialog box
 and the recorder was running.
<li>
