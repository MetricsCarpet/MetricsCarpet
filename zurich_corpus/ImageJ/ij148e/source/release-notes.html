<li> <u>1.48e 19 October 2013</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, plots now use scientific notation for large numbers
and the curve fitter no longer runs on the event queue and can be aborted.
<li> Changed the ROI Manager's "Remove Slice Info" command to
"Remove Positions...".
<li> Line selections are always drawn offset 0.5 pixels down and to the right regardless
of the "Sub-pixel resolution" option in <i>Edit&gt;Options&gt;Profile Plot Options</i>.
<li> Thanks to Miettinen Arttu, <i>File&gt;Import&gt;Raw</i> now decodes image dimensions
embedded in file names (e.g., "name1_512x512.raw", "name2_256x256x256.raw").
<li> The default "Fill with:" option in the <i>File&gt;New&gt;Image</i>
dialog is now "Black".
<li> Added a "Help" button to the <i>Analyze&gt;Gels&gt;Gel Analyzer Options</i>
dialog box.

<i>Analyze&gt;Tools&gt;Curve Fitting</i> to throw and exception when
performing user-defined fits.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a curve fitting bug which could cause unintended
values for the initial parameters (resulting in more iterations than necessary).

work as expected when ImageJ was exited by clicking on the "ImageJ" window's the close box.
<li> Thanks to Pavol Bauer, fixed a bug that caused <i>Process&gt;Batch&gt;Macro</i> to
not open .lsm files using Bio-Formats when the LSM_Reader plugin was not installed.
<li> Fixed bug in the new <i>File&gt;Open Samples&gt;Cache Sample Images</i> command 
that caused it to throw an exception.

method to not work as expected.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that caused the spline fitter to sometimes
not work as expected.

selection or create a centered oval selection if there was an underlying overlay.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused the bounding box of spline fit selections to be incorrect.
