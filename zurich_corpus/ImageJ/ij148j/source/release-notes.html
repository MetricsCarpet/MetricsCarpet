<li> <u>1.48j 11 December 2013</u>
<ul>
<li> The toolbar is now expandable, with support for up to 15 custom tools.
<li> Added the String.show(string) and String.show(title,string) macro functions.
<li> Added a 'G' (draw polygon) command to the macro tool icon generation
language
(<a href="macros/ConvertOverlayToIcon.txt">example</a>).
<li> Thanks to Thomas Suchyna, the <i>Image&gt;Adjust&gt;Threshold</i>
window is resizable on Linux and Windows.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, fixed a bug that caused <i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Straighten</i>
to throw an exception with composite color images with straight line selections.
<li> Thanks to Marcel Boeglin, fixed a bug in the Overlay.crop() method that sometimes caused
 the cropped overlay to be shifted.
<li> Thanks to Marcel Boeglin, fixed bugs in <i>Image&gt;Hyperstacks&gt;Reduce Dimensionality</i>
that caused it to not work correctly with hyperstacks with an overlay and with one channel, non-composite
hyperstacks with a color LUT.
<li> Thanks to Mats Nilsson, and Johannes Schindelin, fixed a 1.48h regression that caused the
getInfo(DICOM-tag) macro function to return empty strings or unexpected values.
<li> Thanks to Dietmar Kunz, fixed a v1.48f regression that caused the ImageProcessor.duplicate()
method to sometimes not work as expected.
<li> Fixed a v1.48h regression that caused the "Select and Transform" tool in TrakEM2 to not work.
